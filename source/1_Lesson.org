- In 1936, a few years before the outbreak of World War II, Alan Turing invented the *Turing Machine*.
- This was a /hypothetical/ device (not one to be actually built) that could read and change symbols on an infinitely long tape, according to a table of rules.
- With this simple idea, Computer Science was born, as the *Turing Machine* was theoretically capable of performing any calculation that was computable.
- It took a few more years before actual computers were constructed, but even today we can talk about computers and programming languages in terms of their =Turing completeness=. This means that they are able to do exactly what a *Turing Machine* can do.

- For this project, we'll be using the Python 3 Programming language.
- You've used Scratch before, which is a Graphical Programming Language. Python does the same sort of thing, but you program using text instead of blocks.
- If you're working on this outside of school, you can download it from the following links.
- [[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/python-3.4.2-macosx10.6.pkg][Python 3.4 for Mac]]
- [[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/python-3.4.2.amd64.msi][Python 3.4 for Windows]]
- If you need Python 3 for Linux - use your package manager =sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3 idle3= (on Ubuntu for instance)
- If you're working in school, then you should find a program called IDLE, in your programs menu.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Open up IDLE. You should be presented with a screen that looks a little like this:
[[file:img/IDLE.png]]
- IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. This means we can create, edit and run Python files using it.
- The screen that popped up is called the =INTERPRETER=. Remember this, and what it looks like.
- We can write code in the interpreter, and it gets executed straight away.

- One of Turing's key ideas was an infinitely long tape, upon which symbols could be added, read and changed.
- In modern computers this tape is called RAM, and is made up of very complex circuits.
- Just like in a Turning machine though, we can add data to RAM, read data from RAM and change data in RAM.** Program It
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Let's write some data to RAM.
#+begin_src python
myName = 'Alice'
#+end_src
- You can obviously use your own name.
- You have now stored your name in RAM. You have done this using a =variable=
- For now think of a =variable= is being made up of an /identifier/ (=myName=) and a /value/ (=Alice=)
*** Note - Once you have hit =ENTER= you can not delete what has been executed, any more than you can unbreak an egg. If you make a mistake, just type it out again (or hit =alt= + =p= on your keyboard to bring up the last command again, and alter it from there.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Turing's original idea called for an infinitely long tape, that we could store an infinite amount of information on.
- RAM is pretty big, if not infinite. A typical Computer might have anywhere between 2Gb and 16Gb or RAM.
- This would be enough space to store between 1000000000 and 4000000000 characters, which is enough for us.
- Try creating some variables for your friend's names. Each one must have it's own unique /identifier/ though
#+begin_src python
firstFriendName = 'Robert'
secondFriendName = 'Charles'
thirdFriendName = 'David'
fourthFriendName = 'Eve'
#+end_src
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- We have to be careful with /identifiers/ for our variables.
- Try this and see what happens:
#+begin_src python
5thFriendName = 'Faith'
#+end_src
- You'll get back a message saying you've used =invalid syntax=.
- This is known as a syntax error. It means you haven't conformed to the rules of the language.
- Here are the rules for Python's Variable Identifiers:
  1. Must not start with a number.
  2. Must not contain symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc.
  3. Must not contain spaces (use =_= or =-= instead)
  4. Are case sensitive (=myname=, =myName=, =MyName= and =MYNAME= would all be different variable identifiers.)
- There's also a few words you should avoid for identifiers, like =not= and =continue=, but you'll learn these as you go along.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Now we have some variables stored, we'd best learn how to read them, as that was one of the stipulations of the Turing machine's tape.
- You can read the value of a variable just by writing it's name.
#+begin_src python
myName
secondFriendName
#+end_src
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- We also needed to be able to change the variables. 
- Let's have a go at that.
#+begin_src python
firstFriendName = 'Bob'
secondFriendName = 'Charlie'
thirdFriendName = 'Dave'
#+end_src
- Now use the identifiers to read the values and make sure they have changed.

- Not all variable values are the same.
- Copy and paste the following into your interpreter - *one line at a time*
#+begin_src python
foo = 10
bar = 3.142
baz = 'Hello World!'
qux = True 
#+end_src
- Now, for each of the variables, find out it's type.
#+begin_src python
type(foo)
#+end_src
- The interpreter will tell you the class of the variable.
#+begin_src python
<class 'dict'>
#+end_src
- This would tell me that the data-type was a =dict=.
- Look up each of the data-types for the variables above and then use the web to find out what they each mean (in simple English).
* Manipulating Variable Values

:END:
- Now you know a little bit about types, we can look at variable in a little more detail.
- Let's imagine you're in a maths class and you are given the following problem.
#+begin_quote
A chicken can lay a single egg, every day. If a chicken lives for seven years, what is the maximum number of eggs it can lay in it's lifetime?
#+end_quote
- We can use Python to help us work this out, using a few simple variables.
#+begin_src python
daysInYear = 365
lifeTime = 7
numberEggs = daysInYear * lifeTime
#+end_src
- We started by assigning two variables to have integer values. Then we assigned a third variable (=numberEggs=) to be the result of multiplying (=*=) the previous variables together.
- In Python we can use =+= and =-= for addition and subtraction, =/= and =*= for division and multiplication.
- There are lots of mathematical =operators= we can use. Here is a table of all of them for reference later on.
| Operator | Description                                           | Example                                         |
|----------+-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| +        | Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator | a + b will give 30                              |
| *        | Multiplication                                        | a * b will give 200                             |
| /        | Division                                              | b / a will give 2                               |
| %        | Modulus - *remainder* of a division                   | b % a will give 0                               |
| **       | To the power of                                       | a**b will give 10 to the power 20               |
| //       | Division and round down                               | 9//2 is equal to 4 and 9.0//2.0 is equal to 4.0 |
- Let's try another one.
#+begin_quote
A snake can slither 20cm in 15 minutes. How many hours would it take the snake to travel 100cm
#+end_quote
#+begin_src python
distance = 100
speed = 20/15
time = distance/speed
#+end_src

- Try the following questions in the same way they have been tackled above. Declare your variables and then a final variable to hold the answer to the question.
  1. A woodchuck can chuck 5 bits of wood in an hour. How long does it take a woodchuck to chuck 45 pieces of wood.
  2. A peck is equal to 9 litres. If Peter picked a peck of pickled peppers and each pepper has a volume of 0.25 litres, how many pickled peppers did Peter pick.
  3. A cannibal can nibble 9 cans in an hour. How many cans can nine cannibals nibble in ninety minutes

- We can easily assign variables to other variables.
#+begin_src python
foo = 10
bar = foo
#+end_src
- Let's find out what =bar= is now.
#+begin_src python
bar
#+end_src
- As you probably expected, it is now 10.
- But what happens if we change =foo=
#+begin_src python
foo = 5
#+end_src
- What's bar now?
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- To see why =bar= stays at 10, we need to think about what happens when we use code like =bar = foo=. We'll talk in terms of a /sort of/ Turing Machine.
- We start off with an empty tape and some empty cards.
[[file:img/tape1.jpg]]
- When we write =foo = 10= two things happen.
  1. The value of 10 is stored on the tape in a certain box. In this case it is box number 4.
  2. The card is then altered so it has the variable identifier and the box it points to.
[[file:img/tape2.jpg]]
- When we then write =bar = foo=, a second card is then used to indicate that =bar= points to the same box number as =foo=.
[[file:img/tape3.jpg]]
- Lastly, when we reassign =foo= the value of 5, a second box (in this case box 8) has 5 stored in it and =foo='s card is altered to now point to the new box.
[[file:img/tape4.jpg]]
- We can see that bar is still pointing to the value in address 4, which is the number 10.
